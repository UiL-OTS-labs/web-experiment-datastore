    <p>
    Dear researcher,
    </p>
    <p>
    {{ user.get_full_name }} has created a new experiment ({{ experiment.title }}) in our web-experiment datastore.
    You can view the details <a href="{{ link }}">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We will now review your experiment and create a folder for your experiment on our server. You will receive an e-mail
    when we are done. We aim to do this within 2 working days.
    </p>
    <p>
    Until your experiment has been approved, you will not be able to upload any experiment data to the application.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have any questions, please reply to this e-mail.
    </p>
    <p>
    Kind regards,<br/>
    the ILS Labs staff
    </p>
