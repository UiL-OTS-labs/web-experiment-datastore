Dear researcher,

{{ user.get_full_name }} has created a new experiment ({{ experiment.title }}) in our web-experiment datastore.
You can view the details here:
{% url 'experiments:detail' experiment.pk %}

We will now review your experiment and create a folder for your experiment on our server. You will receive an e-mail
when we are done.

Until your experiment has been approved, you will not be able to upload any experiment data to the application.

Kind regards,
the UiL OTS Labs staff
