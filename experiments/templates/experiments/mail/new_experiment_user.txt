We will now review your experiment and create a folder for your experiment on our server. You will receive an e-mail
when we are done. We aim to do this within 2 working days.

Until your experiment has been approved, you will not be able to upload any experiment data to the application.

If you have any questions, please reply to this e-mail.

Kind regards,
the UiL OTS Labs staff
