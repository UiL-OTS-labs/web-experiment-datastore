            <h3>What are target groups?</h3>
            <p>
              Many experiments are designed to use multiple item lists, and assign
              participants randomly to those lists. There are currently two ways to
              achieve that with jsPsych:
              <ol>
                <li>Simple randomization in your script</li>
                <li>Balanced randomization using the datastore server</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              Simple randomization requires little effort, and is already implemented in
              our templates. It relies on randomly generated numbers to evenly distribute
              participants between lists over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, you might want better control over the distribution
              of participants to lists. This is where target groups might be useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              By adding target groups to your experiment, you can decide how many participants
              should be assigned per list, and the datastore server would take care to
              assign participants to lists in a balanced fashion. To do that, it keeps track of
              ongoing and completed runs of the experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each target group has a name that should correspond to the relevant list name,
              and a completion target, which indicates the number of completed runs that should
              be reached. When a target group has its completion target fulfilled, no new participants
              will be assigned to the corresponding list.
              You can also modify completion targets to dynamically control the amount of
              participants while the experiment is running.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next paragraphs outline how participant assignment works in somewhat finer detail.
              You can safely skip to <em>Implementation</em> and assume that participants are evenly distributed between groups,
              but it is provided here for reference.
              To simplify things we will describe the algorithm with just two lists—A and B—but it works for any number of groups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suppose that the server keeps track of the next group in turn using a variable called <code>next_group</code>, then:
                <ol>
                    <li>Whenever a new participant is about to start the experiment, assign them to <code>next_group</code>.</li>
                    <li>If <code>next_group</code> is A, set it to B. Otherwise, set it to A.</li>
                    <li>Whenever a participant completes the experiment, check which group has less completed sessions. Set <code>next_group</code> to that.</li>
                </ol>
                Steps 1 and 2 guarantee that an incoming stream of participants will be equally distributed between groups.
                But that is not enough, because some participants will not finish the experiment. So in step 3 we compensate for an uneven
                distribution in completed sessions.
                Whenever a group becomes full (because the target number of completed sesssions was reached) it is taken out of the rotation, and the server
                continues the process with the remaining open groups.
            </p>

            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p>
              If you would like to use target groups with one of our jsPsych templates, look for a section in <code>main.js</code> that starts with:<br/>
              <code>// Option 1: client side randomization:</code><br/>
              and comment out the part below it. Then uncomment the section following:<br/>
              <code>// Option 2: server side balancing:</code><br/>
              (Note: in older templates these sections are located in <code>index.html</code> instead.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure your experiment is set to Open for target groups to work.
            </p>

              The relevant code for interacting with the target groups feature is found in the
              <a href="https://github.com/UiL-OTS-labs/jspsych-uil-utils/blob/main/jspsych-uil-session.js"><code>uil.utils.session</code> module</a>.
