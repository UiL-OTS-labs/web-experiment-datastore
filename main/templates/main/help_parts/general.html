                This application provides safe storage for data collected from
                web-experiments. This guide will describe the process of
                using this application.
            </p>
            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt>Experiment server</dt>
                <dd>We provide a server you can use to host your web-experiment</dd>
                <dt>Webshare</dt>
                <dd>To upload your experiment, we provide a so-called webshare
                    you can mount on your PC</dd>
            </dl>
            <h4>Step 1: Register your experiment</h4>
            <p>
                Make sure that your fellow researchers have logged in to this
                application at least once before registering your experiment,
                otherwise you won't be able to add them to your experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the 'My Experiments' page, click 'Create new experiment'.
                You will be asked for some information:
            </p>
            <p>
                Title: The name of your experiment<br/>
                Experiment folder: The name of the folder you want to hold
                your experiment on the server. <br/>
                Researchers: everyone (including you) that should have access
                to the data and to the experiment web-share
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not intend to use our server to host your experiment,
                please <a href="mailto:{{ labstaff_email }}">contact us</a>.
                This application will not accept data from experiments not
                hosted on an approved server.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Step 2: Approval
            </h4>
            <p>
                Once your experiment has been created, we need to create your
                webshare. This should take 1 to 2 working days, you will be
                notified when we have done so.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Step 3: Couple your experiment to this application
            </h4>
            <p>
                When your experiment has been created, you should be able to
                find the access key to your experiment on the details page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using an experiment provided by us, it should already
                contain the code necessary to upload the data. You only need to
                add the access key.
            </p>
            <p>
                If not, you can find it in the block called '(Developer)
                Uploading data from JavaScript' below.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Step 4: Upload your experiment
            </h4>
            <p>
                You can now upload your experiment to the webshare. Details on
                how to mount the webshare can be found in the block below.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure the main HTML file is called <i>index.html</i>.
                Otherwise, the server cannot find which file should be displayed
                without explicitly adding it to the URL.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Step 5: Open your experiment
            </h4>
            <p>
                By default, all experiments are closed to new uploads. When you
                are ready to send your experiment to participants, you should
                open it by changing its status on the 'Edit experiment' page.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 6: Downloading your data</h4>
            <p>
                Once you've finished collecting data, you can download the data
                on the details page.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a good idea to close your experiment at this point, so
                no new data will be added.<br/>
                Closing the experiment will not take your experiment offline.
                You should remove your experiment from the experiment server as
                well
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Note:</i> Some data might not be uploaded correctly, in which
                case the transforming said data to CSV will fail. When
                downloading all data, an export report will added to the zip
                file. This file will report for every datapoint if transforming
                it to CSV failed or succeeded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Downloading the file as raw data should always work, allowing
                you to see the malformed data if needed.
