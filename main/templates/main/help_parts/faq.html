                How do I upload my web-experiment?
            </strong>
            <p>
                To upload your experiment, you need to upload your experiment
                to the web-share we have provided. See
                <a href="{% url 'main:help' %}#collapse-webdav" target="_blank">Access your experiment folder</a>.
            </p>
            <strong>
                I made changes to the experiment files, but I'm not seeing them when running the experiment from the server!
            </strong>
            <p>
                When you open an experiment in your browser, it may be saved in the browser's <em>cache</em> for some time.
                When later uploading a new version of the experiment, your browser might still load the saved version from cache instead of the newest one.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several different ways to work around that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Start the experiment in an incognito/private window</li>
                    <li>Hold down <em>Shift</em> while refreshing the page</li>
                    <li>Using Chrome or Firefox: open <em>Developer tools</em> (Ctrl-Shift-C or âŒ˜-Shift-C), open the <em>Network</em> tab, and check the <em>Disable Cache</em> checkbox.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <strong>
                Why can't I change the name of my folder on the experiment server?
            </strong>
            <p>
                Any changes to the name requires the lab-staff to do some manual
                changes as well. Please
                <a href="mailto:{{ labstaff_email }}">contact us</a> if you need
                to get the name changed.
            </p>
            <strong>
                I'm trying to upload data to the application, but nothing is
                being saved!
            </strong>
            <p>
                Make sure that the status of your experiment is set to 'Open'.
                The current status of your experiment is shown both on the main
                page as well as the details page.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can change the status of your experiment on the edit page.
            </p>
            <strong>
                Why are my fellow researchers not listed when trying to add them
                to my experiment?
            </strong>
            <p>
                Make sure they have logged into the application at least once.
                Due to technical limitations, this application is not aware of
                anyone that has not logged in.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a teacher in a course and want your students to use
                this application, it might be easier if all your students are
                already registered before the course starts. Please
                <a href="mailto:{{ labstaff_email }}">contact the lab staff</a>,
                they will be able to do add your students to the application in
                bulk.

                I just added a new researcher to my experiment, but they cannot
                access the experiment share.
            </strong>
            <p>
                Giving access to the experiment shares is a manual process.
                Please <a href="mailto:{{ labstaff_email }}">contact us</a>
                to update the access configuration.
            </p>
            <strong>I closed my experiment in this application, but it's still available on the experiment server.</strong>
            <p>
                The data and experiment servers aren't linked directly for
                security reasons. Thus, we cannot take your experiment offline
                automatically when you close the experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're using JSPsych, you can use our library to
                automatically redirect your participant to a generic 'closed'
                page. You can also manually query the status of your experiment
                if you're not using JSPsych.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using one of our templates, chances are that this is
                already set up. Otherwise, please contact us for instructions on
                how to set this up.
